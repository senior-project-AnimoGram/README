## About The Project

If you live with a lovely dog, what you want to know the most is the dog's feelings and thoughts. Simply because dogs cannot speak!


So we thought:
+ Predict breeds & emotions by analyzing your dog's face.
+ Improve dog culture by sharing your dog's emotions.
+ Record your dog's emotions that change depending on the location and understand your dog through statistics.


Animogram, a compound word of animal, emotion, and Instagram, is the perfect project that satisfies all the needs above.
